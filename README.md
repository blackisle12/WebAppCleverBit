Hey guys,

1. For first time use, please open "Package Manager Console" from Visual Studio then run "update-database", please make sure you has SQL Server instance
2. After running the migration scripts,
   2.1 Users are generated (user1 / admin123) (user2 / admin123)
   2.2 10 default matches are added which has an expiry date based on your local time increment from (1 to 10 hours)
